# Attributes and Properties

## Learning Goals

- Differentiate between variables, attributes, and properties.
- Use the `property()` function to create properties and validate input.

***

## Key Vocab

- **Class**: a bundle of data and functionality. Can be copied and modified to
accomplish a wide variety of programming tasks.
- **Initialize**: create a working copy of a class using its `__init__` method.
- **Instance**: one specific working copy of a class. It is created when a
class's `__init__` method is called.
- **Object**: the more common name for an instance. The two can usually be used
interchangeably.
- **Object-Oriented Programming**: programming that is oriented around data
(made mobile and changeable in **objects**) rather than functionality. Python is
an object-oriented programming language.
- **Function**: a series of steps that create, transform, and move data.
- **Method**: a function that is defined inside of a class.
- **Magic Method**: a special type of method in Python that starts and ends with
double underscores. These methods are called on objects under certain conditions
without needing to use their names explicitly. Also called **dunder methods**
(for **d**ouble **under**score).
- **Attribute**: variables that belong to an object.
- **Property**: attributes that are controlled by methods.

## Introduction

So far, we've learned how to build classes and give them instance methods. We
also learned how to use the `__init__` magic method to instantiate objects and
the `self` keyword to modify its **attributes**.

In this lesson, we will continue to explore attributes and **properties**, a
special type of attribute.

***

## Class Attributes vs Instance Attributes

Let's take a look at a class definition:

```py
class Human:
    species = "Homo sapiens"
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
```

This class, `Human`, takes a `name` as an argument for its initialization method
and saves it as an attribute of `self`. This attribute varies from one instance
of the `Human` class to the next, so we call this an _instance attribute_.

Since `species` is set outside the scope of any methods, it is a _class
attribute_. All members of the `Human` class have the same `species`, so this
makes more sense than setting the same value for every new human upon
instantation.

An interesting note about class attributes is that they can be accessed on the
class itself, in addition to any instances:

```py
guido = Human("Guido")
guido.species
# => Homo sapiens
Human.species
# => Homo sapiens
```

Since `name` is an instance attribute, calling it on the `Human` class will
result in an error:

```py
guido = Human("Guido")
guido.name
# => Guido
Human.name
# => AttributeError: type object 'Human' has no attribute 'name'
```

<details><summary><em>If we enter <code>guido.nationality = "Dutch"</code>
into the interpreter, will <code>nationality</code> be a class or instance
attribute?</em></summary>
<p>

<h3>Instance Attribute</h3>
<p>Because it is assigned to an object, it is an instance attribute.</p>
<p>The <code>Human</code> class remains unchanged.</p>
</details>
<br/>

***

## Setting and Getting Attributes

Many programming languages opt to protect their objects' attributes and methods
(members). They accomplish this by making the distinction between _public_,
_private_, and _protected_. These terms are good to know, as you will almost
certainly encounter them in your software career:

- _Public_ members are available to anyone that can access the class.
- _Private_ members are available to the class that instantiated them.
- _Protected_ members are available to the class that instantiated them and any
object that inherits from that class, but is not accessible otherwise.

Python does not make the distinction between public, private, and protected.
This makes it very easy for us to manipulate the members of a class or object
with dot notation:

```py
class Human:
    species = "Homo sapiens"
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name

guido = Human("Guido")
guido.species
# => Homo sapiens
guido.name
# => Guido

# Changing species and name using dot notation
guido.species = "Python programmer"
guido.name = "Guido van Rossum"

guido.species
# => Python programmer
guido.name
# => Guido van Rossum

# Adding new attributes using dot notation
guido.nationality = "Dutch"
guido.nationality
# => Dutch
```

**Because it is so simple to modify the attributes of classes and objects in
Python, it is very rare that we write extra code to get or set attributes.**

Python also provides us a few built-in functions to manipulate attributes:

- `getattr()` retrieves the value of an attribute.
- `setattr()` changes the value of an attribute, just as you would with dot
notation.
- `hasattr()` checks for the presence of an attribute.
- `delattr()` removes an attribute from a class or object.

You might be wondering at this point why `getattr()` and `setattr()` even exist
when dot notation can be used to accomplish the same tasks:

```py
# Getting
guido.name
# => Guido van Rossum
getattr(guido, "name")
# => Guido van Rossum

#Setting
guido.nationality = "Dutch"
setattr(guido, "nationality", "Dutch")
```

The value in Python's `attr()` functions comes in their ability to create,
retrieve, update, and delete attributes for which the names are unknown.

> NOTE: `getattr()` also allows us to provide an optional third argument as a
> default value if the attribute does not exist.

```py
my_attr = "is_a_friend"
getattr(guido, my_attr, False)
# => False

# Oh no! Let's try again.
setattr(guido, my_attr, True)
getattr(guido, my_attr, False)
# => True
```

<details><summary><em>Which <code>attr()</code> function checks for the
presence of an attribute?</em></summary>
<p>

<h3><code>hasattr()</code></h3>
<p><code>hasattr()</code> checks for the presence of an attribute and returns
<code>True</code> or <code>False</code>.</p>
</details>

## Properties

Python's flexibility with respect to members of classes and objects is very
useful to us, but sometimes we need to prepare for bad actors (like me, right
now):

```py
# Setting Guido's age
guido.age = False

```

It is always best practice to make our code as descriptive and easy to interpret
as possible. Still, there are people who may not understand what we intended or
who want to break our program. It's clear that we want Guido's age to be a
numerical value between 0 and some reasonable upper limit (we'll say 120). When
we need to make sure an attribute meets a certain set of criteria, we need to
configure it as a **property**.

**Properties** in Python are attributes that are controlled by methods. The
function of these methods is to make sure that the value of our property makes
sense. We can configure **properties** using our knowledge of object-oriented
programming and Python's built-in `property()` function. Open up the Python
shell or a Python file to follow along:

```py
class Human:
    species = "Homo sapiens"

    def __init__(self, age):
        self.age = age

    def get_age(self):
        print("Retrieving age.")
        return self._age

    def set_age(self, age):
        print(f"Setting age to { age }")
        self._age = age

    age = property(get_age, set_age)

```

Let's break this down a bit:

- `get_age()` is compiled by the `property` function and prints `"Retrieving
  age"` when we access age through dot notation or an `attr()` function.
- `set_age()` is compiled by the `property()` function and prints `"Setting age
  to { age }"` when we change our human's age.
- The `property()` function compiles our getter and setter and calls them
  whenever anyone accesses our human's age.

Notice the _single underscore_ we place before the age attribute. This tells
other Python programmers that this is meant to be treated as a _private_ member
of the class. It is not truly private, but it is a way to tell your coworkers
that this is a **property** and there are methods that depend on its name and
values.

> NOTE: This is still not a true _private_ value; you can still manipulate it
> with dot notation and `attr()` functions (though you shouldn't!)

There's still a problem- we're not checking if the age is a number between 0 and
120. Let's make one last change to finish our `Human` class:

```py
class Human:
    species = "Homo sapiens"

    def __init__(self, age):
        self.age = age

    def get_age(self):
        print("Retrieving age.")
        return self._age

    def set_age(self, age):
        if (type(age) in (int, float)) and (0 <= age <= 120):
            print(f"Setting age to { age }.")
            self._age = age

        else:
            print("Age must be a number between 0 and 120.")

    age = property(get_age, set_age)
```

Now we have a proper **property** set up. Let's make sure it works:

```py
guido = Human(age=67)
# => Setting age to 67.
guido.age = 0
# => Setting age to 0.
guido.age = False
# => Age must be a number between 0 and 120
guido.age = 66
# => Setting age to 66.
guido.age
# => Retrieving age.
# => 66
```

standard attribute?</em></summary>
<p>

<h3>When you need to validate input.</h3>
<p>By default, Python allows us to change any attribute to any value. If we
need an attribute to be within a certain range of values and we cannot
guarantee this will happen, we should configure a property.</p>

function][python docs property].

## Instructions

Fork and clone the lab and run `pytest -x`. To get the tests passing, you will
need to complete the following tasks:

### `Dog` and `lib/dog.py`

1. Define a `name` property for your `Dog` class. The name must be of type `str`
and between 1 and 25 characters. Your `__init__` method should receive a default
argument for `name`.
    - If the name is invalid, the setter method should `print()` "Name must be
string between 1 and 25 characters."
2. Define a `breed` property for your `Dog` class. Your `__init__` method should
   receive a default argument for `breed`.
    - If the breed is invalid, the setter method should `print()` "Breed must be
in list of approved breeds." The breed must be in the following list of dog
breeds:

```py
approved_breeds = ["Mastiff", "Chihuahua", "Corgi", "Shar Pei", "Beagle", "French Bulldog", "Pug", "Pointer"]
```

![Dog
Breeds](https://curriculum-content.s3.amazonaws.com/module-1/ruby-oo-fundamentals/object-attributes-lab/Image_142_CommonDogBreeds.png)

### `Person` and `lib/person.py`

1. Define a `name` property for your `Person` class. The name must be of type
`str` and between 1 and 25 characters. The name should be converted to [title
case](https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_string_title.asp#:~:text=The%20title()%20method%20returns,be%20converted%20to%20upper%20case.)
before it is saved. Your `__init__` method should receive a default argument for
`name`.
    - If the name is invalid, the setter method should `print()` "Name must be
string between 1 and 25 characters."
2. Define a `job` property for your `Person` class. Your `__init__` method should
   receive a default argument for `job`.
    - If the job is invalid, the setter method should `print()` "Job mu1st be in
list of approved jobs." The job must be in the following list of jobs:

```py
approved_jobs = ["Admin", "Customer Service", "Human Resources", "ITC", "Production", "Legal", "Finance", "Sales", "General Management", "Research & Development", "Marketing", "Purchasing"]
```

> **NOTE: Because we want to instantiate our Dogs and People with their
> properties, remember to include set values in `__init__()` using the
> _property_ name and not the protected _attribute_ name.**

## Conclusion

Python allows us to manipulate objects very easily with dot notation and its
built-in `attr()` functions. This flexibility makes it very easy to accomplish
any number of tasks, but there are times when we need to be more selective about
the types of changes that are saved to our objects and classes. Python's
`property()` function gives us the ability to validate attributes before they
are saved to the classes and objects we've worked so hard to make.
